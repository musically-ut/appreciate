Appreciate the free stuff.

Node's eco-system is exploding and there are a ton of open source code out there which gets used over and over again. However, it is easy to forget to say _thank-you_ whenever you use one of the projects.

The smallest "thank-you" you can say to a project is by starring its repository on Github (if it has one).

Run this program in the directory of your node project to see which packages you are using and whether you have _thanked_ them by starring them on Github.

-- 

To use the package, simple [generate an access token from your Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) without any special scopes and put the string in the file `~/.appreciate`.

Smile!
